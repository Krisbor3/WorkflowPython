It's time for a challenge!

You’ve just joined a team that’s developing an API for mobile applications. They’re using containers for the first time and need to set up a CI/CD pipeline to publish container images.

Their last project used an integration workflow for python and the plan is to use that workflow on the new project as well.

The team has asked you to help them set up a repo for the integration workflow so it can be used in the latest project and any new projects that come up in the future.
